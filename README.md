# go-basics-examples
This is a "Go" basic programming examples.

#### Project solves below assignments

1.  Write a program which prompts the user to enter a floating point number and
	prints the integer which is a truncated version of the floating point number that was entered.

2. Write a program which prompts the user to enter a string. 
   The program searches through the entered string for the characters ‘i’, ‘a’, and ‘n’. 
   The program should print “Found!” if the entered string starts with the character ‘i’, 
   ends with the character ‘n’, and contains the character ‘a’. The program should print “Not Found!” otherwise. 
   The program should not be case-sensitive, so it does not matter if the characters are upper-case or lower-case.
